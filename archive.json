Software consumers have no way to \"validate\" that a digitally signed object, i.e., Program A produced by supplier S that is signed using a certificate owned by party D is legitimate. Software consumers that need to establish trust in Program A need a reliable method to confirm that Supplier S authorized signer D to sign Program A as part of digital signature verification during a software supply chain risk assessment.  \r\n\r\nCurrent digital signature verification practices only check that the signers certificate is valid and the MAC in the signature matches the computed hash of the signed artifact i.e. Program A (integrity verification), but does not provide any assurance as to the trustworthiness of the relationship between a signer in the digital signature and the supplier of an artifact. Anyone can sign anything today, without authorization from the originator of an artifact and the digital signature verification check will pass. \r\n",
