                  draft-ietf-rats-epoch-markers-latest

Abstract

   This document defines Epoch Markers as a way to establish a notion of
   freshness among actors in a distributed system.  Epoch Markers are
   similar to "time ticks" and are produced and distributed by a
   dedicated system, the Epoch Bell.  Systems that receive Epoch Markers
   do not have to track freshness using their own understanding of time
   (e.g., via a local real-time clock).  Instead, the reception of a
   certain Epoch Marker establishes a new epoch that is shared between
   all recipients.  This documents defines Epoch Marker payloads,
   including CBOR time tags, RFC 3161 TimeStampToken, or nonce-like
   structures, as well as a CWT Claim to embed Epoch Markers in RFC 8392
   CBOR Web Tokens as a vehicle for signed protocol messages.

1.  Introduction

   Systems that need to interact securely often require a shared
   understanding of the freshness of conveyed information.  This is
   certainly the case in the domain of remote attestation procedures.
   In general, securely establishing a shared notion of freshness of the
   exchanged information among entities in a distributed system is not a
   simple task.

   The entire Appendix A of [RFC9334] deals solely with the topic of
   freshness, which is in itself an indication of how relevant, and
   complex, it is to establish a trusted and shared understanding of
   freshness in a RATS system.

   This document defines Epoch Markers as a way to establish a notion of
   freshness among actors in distributed systems.  Epoch Markers are
   similar to "time ticks" and are produced and distributed by a
   dedicated system, the Epoch Bell.  Actors in a system that receive
   Epoch Markers do not have to track freshness using their own
   understanding of time (e.g., via a local real-time clock).  Instead,
   the reception of a certain Epoch Marker establishes a new epoch that
   is shared between all recipients.  In essence, the emissions and
   corresponding receptions of Epoch Markers are like the ticks of a
   clock where the ticks are conveyed over the Internet.

   In general (barring highly symmetrical topologies), epoch ticking
   incurs differential latency due to the non-uniform distribution of
   receivers with respect to the Epoch Bell.  This introduces skew that
   needs to be taken into consideration when Epoch Markers are used.

   While all Epoch Markers share the same core property of behaving like
   clock ticks in a shared domain, various "epoch id" payloads are
   defined in this document to accommodate different use cases and
   diverse kinds of Epoch Bells.

   While most Epoch Markers types are encoded in CBOR [STD94], and many
   of the epoch id types are themselves encoded in CBOR, a prominent
   format in this space is the TimeStampToken (TST) defined by
   [RFC3161], a DER-encoded TSTInfo value wrapped in a CMS envelope
   [RFC5652].  TSTs are produced by Time-Stamp Authorities (TSA) and
   exchanged via the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP).  At the time of writing,
   TSAs are the most common providers of secure time-stamping services.

Internet-Draft                Epoch Markers                   April 2025


   Therefore, reusing the core TSTInfo structure as an epoch id type for
   Epoch Markers is instrumental for enabling smooth migration paths and
   promote interoperability.  There are, however, several other ways to
   represent a signed timestamp or the start of a new freshness epoch,
   respectively, and therefore other Epoch Marker types.

   To inform the design, this document discusses a number of interaction
   models in which Epoch Markers are expected to be exchanged.  The
   default top-level structure of Epoch Markers described in this
   document are CBOR Web Tokens [RFC8392].  An extensible set of Epoch
   Marker types as well as the em CWT Claim to include them in CWTs are
   specified using CDDL [RFC8610].  CWTs are signed using [STD96] and
   come with the advantage of wide tool support.  Nevertheless, CWTs are
   not the only vehicle Epoch Markers can be embedded in.  Epoch Markers
   can be included in any type of message that allows for embedding
   opaque bytes or CBOR data items (e.g., the Collection CMW in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] or the CWT Claims Header Parameter
   of [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture]).

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] is used to describe the data
   formats.  The examples in Appendix A use the CBOR Extended Diagnostic
   Notation (EDN) [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals].

2.  Epoch IDs

   The RATS architecture introduces the concept of Epoch IDs that mark
   certain events during remote attestation procedures ranging from
   simple handshakes to rather complex interactions including elaborate
   freshness proofs.  The Epoch Markers defined in this document are a
   solution that includes the lessons learned from TSAs, the concept of
   Epoch IDs defined in the RATS architecture, and provides several
   means to identify a new freshness epoch.  Some of these methods are
   introduced and discussed in Section 10.3 of the RATS architecture
   [RFC9334].

3.  Interaction Models

   The interaction models illustrated in this section are derived from
   the RATS Reference Interaction Models.  In general, there are three
   interaction models:

Internet-Draft                Epoch Markers                   April 2025


   *  ad-hoc requests (e.g., via challenge-response requests addressed
      at Epoch Bells), corresponding to Section 7.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]

   *  unsolicited distribution (e.g., via uni-directional methods, such
      as broad- or multicasting from Epoch Bells), corresponding to
      Section 7.2 in [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]

   *  solicited distribution (e.g., via a subscription to Epoch Bells),
      corresponding to Section 7.3 in
      [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]

   In all three interaction models, Epoch Markers can be used as content
   for the generic information element 'handle'.  Handles are most
   useful to establish freshness in unsolicited and solicited
   distribution by the Epoch Bell.  An Epoch Marker can be used as a
   nonce in challenge-response remote attestation (e.g., for limiting
   the number of ad-hoc requests by a Verifier).  Using an Epoch Marker
   requires the challenger to acquire an Epoch Marker beforehand, which
   may introduce a sensible overhead compared to using a simple nonce.

4.  Epoch Marker Structure

   At the top level, an Epoch Marker is a CBOR array carrying the actual
   epoch id (Section 4.1) and an optional veracity proof about the Epoch
   Bell.

                     Figure 1: Epoch Marker definition

   The veracity proof can be encoded in an Evidence or Attestation
   Result conceptual message [RFC9334], e.g., using [I-D.ietf-rats-eat],
   [TCG-CoEvidence], [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si], or SCITT receipts
   [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].

4.1.  Epoch Marker Payloads

   This memo comes with a set of predefined payloads.

4.1.1.  CBOR Time Tags

   A CBOR time representation choosing from CBOR tag 0 (tdate, RFC3339
   time as a string), tag 1 (time, Posix time as int or float) or tag
   1001 (extended time data item), optionally bundled with a nonce.

   See Section 3 of [RFC9581] for the (many) details about the CBOR
   extended time format (tag 1001).  See [STD94] for tdate (tag 0) and
   time (tag 1).

   cbor-epoch-id = [
      cbor-time
      ? nonce
   ]

   etime = #6.1001({* (int/tstr) => any})

   cbor-time = tdate / time / etime

   nonce = tstr / bstr / int

   The following describes each member of the cbor-epoch-id map.

   etime:  A freshly sourced timestamp represented as either time or
      tdate ([STD94], [RFC8610]) or etime [RFC9581].

   nonce:  An optional random byte string used as extra data in
      challenge-response interaction models (see
      [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models]).

4.1.1.1.  Creation

   To generate the cbor-time value, the emitter MUST follow the
   requirements in Section 4.2.

   If a nonce is generated, the emitter MUST follow the requirements in
   Section 4.3.

4.1.2.  Classical RFC 3161 TST Info

   DER-encoded [X.690] TSTInfo [RFC3161].  See Appendix A.1 for the
   layout.

   classical-rfc3161-TST-info = bytes

   The following describes the classical-rfc3161-TST-info type.

   classical-rfc3161-TST-info:  The DER-encoded TSTInfo generated by a
      [RFC3161] Time Stamping Authority.

4.1.2.1.  Creation

   The Epoch Bell MUST use the following value as MessageImprint in its
   request to the TSA:

   }

   This is the sha-256 hash of the string "EPOCH_BELL".

   The TimeStampToken obtained by the TSA MUST be stripped of the TSA
   signature.  Only the TSTInfo is to be kept the rest MUST be
   discarded.  The Epoch Bell COSE signature will replace the TSA
   signature.

4.1.3.  CBOR-encoded RFC3161 TST Info


   // Issue tracked at: https://github.com/ietf-rats/draft-birkholz-
   rats-epoch-marker/issues/18

   The TST-info-based-on-CBOR-time-tag is semantically equivalent to
   classical [RFC3161] TSTInfo, rewritten using the CBOR type system.

   policy:
      A [RFC9090] object identifier tag (111 or 112) representing the
      TSA's policy under which the tst-info was produced.  Cf. policy,
      Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   messageImprint:
      A [RFC9054] COSE_Hash_Find array carrying the hash algorithm
      identifier and the hash value of the time-stamped datum.  Cf.
      messageImprint, Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   serialNumber:
      A unique integer value assigned by the TSA to each issued tst-
      info.  Cf. serialNumber, Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   eTime:
      The time at which the tst-info has been created by the TSA.  Cf.
      genTime, Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].  Encoded as extended time
      [RFC9581], indicated by CBOR tag 1001, profiled as follows:

   *  The "base time" is encoded using key 1, indicating Posix time as
      int or float.

   *  The stated "accuracy" is encoded using key -8, which indicates the
      maximum allowed deviation from the value indicated by "base time".
      The duration map is profiled to disallow string keys.  This is an
      optional field.

   *  The map MAY also contain one or more integer keys, which may
      encode supplementary information
      // Allowing unsigned integer (i.e., critical) keys goes counter
      // interoperability.

   ordering:
      boolean indicating whether tst-info issued by the TSA can be
      ordered solely based on the "base time".  This is an optional
      field, whose default value is "false".  Cf. ordering,
      Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   nonce:
      int value echoing the nonce supplied by the requestor.  Cf. nonce,
      Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   tsa:
      a single-entry GeneralNames array Section 11.8 of
      [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert] providing a hint in identifying
      the name of the TSA.  Cf. tsa, Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

   $$TSTInfoExtensions:
      A CDDL socket (Section 3.9 of [RFC8610]) to allow extensibility of
      the data format.  Note that any extensions appearing here MUST
      match an extension in the corresponding request.  Cf. extensions,
      Section 2.4.2 of [RFC3161].

4.1.3.1.  Creation

   The Epoch Bell MUST use the following value as messageImprint in its
   request to the TSA:

4.1.4.  Epoch Tick

   An Epoch Tick is a single opaque blob sent to multiple consumers.

   ; Epoch-Tick

   epoch-tick = tstr / bstr / int

   The following describes the epoch-tick type.

   epoch-tick:  Either a string, a byte string, or an integer used by
      RATS roles within a trust domain as extra data included in
      conceptual messages [RFC9334] to associate them with a certain
      epoch.

4.1.4.1.  Creation

   The emitter MUST follow the requirements in Section 4.3.

4.1.5.  Multi-Nonce-List

   A list of nonces send to multiple consumer.  The consumers use each
   Nonce in the list of Nonces sequentially.  Technically, each
   sequential Nonce in the distributed list is not used just once, but
   by every Epoch Marker consumer involved.  This renders each Nonce in
   the list a Multi-Nonce

      trust domain as extra data in the production of conceptual
      messages as specified by the RATS architecture [RFC9334] to
      associate them with a certain epoch.  Each nonce in the list is
      used in a consecutive production of a conceptual messages.
      Asserting freshness of a conceptual message including a nonce from
      the multi-nonce-list requires some state on the receiver side to
      assess if that nonce is the appropriate next unused nonce from the
      multi-nonce-list.

4.1.5.1.  Creation

   The emitter MUST follow the requirements in Section 4.3.

4.1.6.  Strictly Monotonically Increasing Counter

   A strictly monotonically increasing counter.

   The counter context is defined by the Epoch bell.

   strictly-monotonic-counter = uint

   The following describes the strictly-monotonic-counter type.

   strictly-monotonic-counter:  An unsigned integer used by RATS roles
      in a trust domain as extra data in the production of of conceptual
      messages as specified by the RATS architecture [RFC9334] to
      associate them with a certain epoch.  Each new strictly-monotonic-
      counter value must be higher than the last one.

4.2.  Time Requirements

   Time MUST be sourced from a trusted clock.

4.3.  Nonce Requirements

   A nonce MUST be freshly generated.  The generated value MUST have at
   least 64 bits of entropy (before encoding).  The generated value MUST
   be generated via a cryptographically secure random number generator.

   A maximum nonce size of 512 bits is set to limit the memory
   requirements.  All receivers MUST be able to accommodate the maximum
   size.
